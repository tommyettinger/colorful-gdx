/**
 * Contains code for manipulating colors as {@code int} and packed {@code float} values in the Oklab color space.
 * Oklab is a very new color space that builds on the same foundation as IPT, but seems to be better-calibrated for
 * uniform lightness and colorfulness, instead of just the emphasis on uniform hue that IPT has. Relative to IPT, Oklab
 * has a noticeably smaller range in chromatic channels (IPT's protan and tritan can range past 0.8 or as low as 0.35,
 * but the similar A and B channels in Oklab don't stray past about 0.65 at the upper end, if that), but it does this so
 * the difference between two Oklab colors is just the Euclidean distance between their components. A slight difference
 * between Oklab and IPT here is that IPT shrinks the chromatic channels to store their -1 to 1 range in a color float's
 * 0 to 1 range, then offsets the shrunken range from -0.5 to 0.5, to 0 to 1; Oklab does not need to shrink the range,
 * and only offsets it in the same way (both just add 0.5).
 * <br>
 * Here's <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Bj√∂rn Ottosson's original post introducing Oklab</a>.
 * So far, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/color/2021/01/18/oklab-critique.html">it stood up to analysis by Raph
 * Levien</a>, and seems to be gaining fans quickly.

	 * Gets a packed float representation of a color given as 4 float components, here, L (luminance or lightness), A
	 * (a chromatic component ranging from greenish to reddish, called protan in IPT), B (a chromatic component ranging
	 * from bluish to yellowish, called tritan in IPT), and alpha (or opacity). As long as you use a batch with
	 * {@link Shaders#fragmentShaderOklab} as its shader, colors passed with
	 * {@link com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.g2d.Batch#setPackedColor(float)} will be interpreted as Oklab. L should be
	 * between 0 and 1, inclusive, with 0 used for very dark colors (almost only black), and 1 used for very light
	 * colors (almost only white). A and B range from 0.0 to 1.0, with grayscale results when both are about 0.5.
	 * There's some aesthetic value in changing just one chroma value. When A is high and B is low, the color is more
	 * purple/magenta, when both are low it is more bluish, when B is high and A is low, the color tends to be greenish,
	 * and when both are high it tends to be orange. When A and B are both near 0.5f, the color is closer to gray.
	 * Alpha is the multiplicative opacity of the color, and acts like RGBA's alpha.
	 * <br>
	 * This method bit-masks the resulting color's byte values, so any values can technically be given to this as
	 * L, A, and B, but they will only be reversible from the returned float color to the original L,
	 * A, and B values if the original values were in the range that {@link #channelL(float)}, {@link #channelA(float)},
	 * and {@link #channelB(float)} return. You can use {@link #inGamut(float, float, float)} to check if a given set of
	 * L, A, and B values is in-gamut, that is, it can be converted to and from an RGB color without going out of the
	 * valid range. If you just want to enforce that a color is in-gamut, you can use
	 * {@link #limitToGamut(float, float, float, float)}, which takes the same parameters this method does, or
	 * {@link #limitToGamut(float)} if you already have a packed float color that could be out-of-gamut.

	 * Given a 1D int index between 0 and 65535 (both inclusive), this treats the 1D index as two parts (lightness and

	 * and hue. The index can be constructed from a lightness value {@code L} from 0 to 255, and a hue value {@code H}
	 * from 0 to 255 with: {@code (L << 8 | H)} or the simpler equivalent {@code (L * 256 + H)}. These assume L and H
	 * have been limited to the 0 to 255 range already. This does not bounds-check index. Because hue is not typically
	 * measured between 0 and 255, getting that value is a bit different; you can use
	 * {@link TrigTools#atan2Turns(float, float)} (with an Oklab color's B for y, then its A for x) and multiply it by 256
	 * to get H.
	 * <br>
	 * The distance this returns is a byte between 0 and 84 (both inclusive), as the Euclidean distance from the center
	 * grayscale value at the lightness in the index, to the edge of the gamut at the same lightness, along the hue in
	 * the index. This is measured in a space from -1 to 1 for both A and B, with the 0 in the center meaning grayscale,
	 * and multiplied by 256 to get a meaningful byte value. To return to the A and B values Oklab uses here, you would
	 * need to use some trigonometry on the hue (if it's in the 0 to 1 range, you can call
	 * {@link TrigTools#cosTurns(float)} on the hue to almost get A, and {@link TrigTools#sinTurns(float)} to almost get B),
	 * then multiply each of those by the distance, divide each by 256.0, and add 0.5.
	 * <br>
	 * Only intended for the narrow cases where external code needs read-only access to the internal Oklab gamut data.
	 * The gamut data is quite large (it is in a 71 KB source file containing only the gamut, while the entire IPT_HQ
	 * ColorTools file is 56 KB, and includes everything else except a gamut table), so it's better to have
	 * direct read access to it without being able to accidentally rewrite it.
